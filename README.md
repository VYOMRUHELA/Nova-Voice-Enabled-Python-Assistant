# Nova-Voice-Enabled-Python-Assistant
This was an exciting step toward AI-driven automation, and I plan to keep expanding Nova’s capabilities with APIs, context awareness, and natural language understanding.
Nova is a Python-based voice assistant that listens for a wake word ("nova"), processes commands, and performs tasks such as opening websites, searching Wikipedia, telling jokes, playing songs, and telling the time. Built with pyttsx3 for speech synthesis and speech_recognition for capturing voice input.
This project took lots of research and effort and i am planning to update it time to time as i keep learning and growing
